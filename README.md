# 🚀 Git & GitHub Basics

Welcome to my personal GitHub learning and practice repository!  
This project helps me **master Git & GitHub** by working on real code, and learning version control workflows.

---

## 📌 What is Git?

> Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code over time.  
> It allows collaboration, history tracking, branching, and much more.

---

## 🌐 What is GitHub?

> GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories.  
> It allows you to push your local code to the cloud, collaborate with others, open-source your work, and manage projects more effectively.

## 🧠 Concepts I'm Learning

- ✅ Initializing a local Git repository
- ✅ Tracking changes using `git status`
- ✅ Staging & committing with messages
- ✅ Connecting to GitHub
- ✅ Pushing local code to GitHub
- ✅ Creating and organizing folders
- 🟨 Working with branches (Coming Soon)

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

git status                   # Check which files are tracked/untracked

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git branch -M main           # Rename current branch to main
git push -u origin main      # Push to GitHub for the first time
git push origin main         # Push later changes

git pull origin main         # Pull changes from GitHub
